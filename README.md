# 4-Stage-Pipeline

## ESE 345 Spring 2020 Project

### Pipelining refers to the "stages" for each instruction to be processed in the unit

* Stage 1: Instruction Fetch

* Stage 2: Decoding the instructions and writing the appropriate operands/operators to the registers

* Stage 3: Executing the instruction on the appropriate registers

* Stage 4: Writing the result into the appropriate register

### 4 clock cycles will be needed to execute one instruction
